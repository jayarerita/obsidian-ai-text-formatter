3. Choose your preferred model for each service
4. Each model shows context length and capability information
5. Changes take effect immediately for new requests

See the [Model Selection Guide](MODEL_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed information about all available models.

### Custom Prompts

The plugin allows you to fully customize the AI prompts used for each format type, giving you complete control over how your text is processed and formatted.

#### How to Customize Prompts

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí AI Text Formatter**
2. Navigate to the **Custom Prompts** section
3. Edit the prompt for any format type (Notes, Prose, To-Do List)
4. Use `{text}` as a placeholder where your selected text will be inserted
5. Save your changes - they take effect immediately

#### Prompt Guidelines

- **Use `{text}` placeholder**: This is where your selected text will be inserted
- **Be specific**: Clear instructions produce better results
- **Include context**: Mention the desired output format and style
- **Set expectations**: Specify length, tone, and structure requirements

#### Example Custom Prompts

**Meeting Notes Format:**

```text
Transform the following voice transcription into professional meeting notes with clear action items and decisions. Use headers for different topics and bullet points for details: {text}
```

**Academic Writing:**

```text

```

#### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific about format**: "Use markdown headers" vs "organize well"
- **Specify tone**: Professional, casual, academic, creative, etc.
- **Include length guidance**: "Keep it concise" or "provide detailed explanations"

#### Default Prompts

The plugin comes with optimized default prompts for each format:

- **Notes**: Creates structured content with headers and bullet points
- **Prose**: Generates flowing, well-formatted paragraphs
- **To-Do List**: Produces actionable checkbox items

You can always reset to defaults if needed by clearing the custom prompt field.
